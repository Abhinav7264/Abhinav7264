## Hi there my name is Abhinav Mohan 👋

🚀 Welcome to my awesome repository!
Where wild ideas turn into reality 🔧⚡

I'm a System Engineer with years of hands-on experience in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) 🏗️, and these days I'm diving deep into the world of DevOps 🌐—automating everything I can get my hands on 🤖 and building cool, efficient, and scalable solutions 💡.

💻 From scripting madness to deploying with style, I'm all about:

📦 Containerizing all the things

☁️ Playing with the cloud

🛠️ Tinkering with tools & tech to make workflows faster and smarter

Stay tuned—more awesome projects coming soon!
Let’s connect and build something epic together! ✨
